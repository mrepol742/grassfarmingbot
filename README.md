# getgrass-bot

This repository contains the code for `getgrass-bot`, a bot designed to establish WebSocket connections through various HTTP and SOCKS proxies, specifically aimed at farming for Grass Airdrop Season 2.

## Overview

`getgrass-bot` connects to a specified WebSocket server using both HTTP and SOCKS proxies. It leverages the `ws` library for WebSocket communication and integrates the `https-proxy-agent` and `socks-proxy-agent` libraries for enhanced proxy support. This allows for more versatile and resilient connections, accommodating a wider range of proxy types.

     ```

   - Copy the value, which is your user ID.

2. In .env list your user IDs in this pattern:

   ```text
   UID=['id1','id2','id3']
   ```

3. To specify proxies, create a file named `proxy.txt` in the project directory and add your desired proxy URLs, following the same new-line format, like this:

   ```text
   http://username:password@hostname:port
   socks5://username:password@hostname:port
